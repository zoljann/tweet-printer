# Tweet Printer

A full-stack web page project with a tight deadline, aimed at creating a simple and fast web application using TypeScript, VueJS, and SASS as a CSS preprocessor. The main goal is to enable users to input a tweet URL, generating a preview of a product like an image or a custom-designed item such as a mug, with options for quick ordering via pickup, credit card, or PayPal that is integrated in web-app. The application prioritizes mobile-friendly design and interactivity, offering features like currency selection, showcasing popular items, shopping cart functionality, and product customization. Additionally, an admin panel enables tracking through Google Analytics and provides access to a route (/narudzbe) displaying previews of all orders, facilitating order management and status updates.
